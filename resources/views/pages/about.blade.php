                <p class="card-text"> In an ever-changing world, knowledge is power. However, as information becomes
                    easier and easier
                    to find, so does misinformation. Intended to deceive, the so-called 'fake news' spread like a
                    virus, thus making it important that the information comes from reliable sources. Therefore, a
                    collaborative news platform is a good way to prevent this malice, granting each user the right
                    to upvote or downvote an post, acting as a social quality filter. Furthermore, it also
                    provides a good way of bringing students from different institutions and backgrounds together.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">This project aims to provide an online collaborative news platform for
                    students. People can post about their favorite topics and share some knowledge with the academic
                    community. Sharing is caring.
